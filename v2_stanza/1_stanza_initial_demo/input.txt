While in college, I had the opportunity to work on my own entrepreneurial endeavors enabled by non-equity seed funding through the college. I used these resources to build a couple of small projects that were operationally viable, and used this knowledge and experience with future endeavors. I currently work as the head of a small geospatial analysis company that finds suitable locations to install a distributed GNSS network for self driving vehicles, land surveying, and farm vehicles. We are continuing to find different avenues and solutions for our customers in the security and humanitarian arena.
My name is *****. I am a software engineer and I also am working on creating to products that hopefully will turn into real companies. I am passionate about creating technology that will impact users positively and provide value digitally and in the physical world.
I have worked for several tech startups, most often being one of the first 5 employees at a given company. I primarily have assisted in the commercialization of services, attempting to bring those services to market. I am currently in the early stages of developing a video game that will take place in the real world, much like Pokemon Go.
