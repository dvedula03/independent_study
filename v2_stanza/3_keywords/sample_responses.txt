While in college, I had the opportunity to work on my own entrepreneurial endeavors enabled by non-equity seed funding through the college. I used these resources to build a couple of small projects that were operationally viable, and used this knowledge and experience with future endeavors. I currently work as the head of a small geospatial analysis company that finds suitable locations to install a distributed GNSS network for self driving vehicles, land surveying, and farm vehicles. We are continuing to find different avenues and solutions for our customers in the security and humanitarian arena.
